# :cake: Misc tips and tricks

This document contains tips and links to resources that might save some time getting started.

## Start a new Project as part of the Sequlite ALF Solution

* Right click on the solution and select Add...> New Project...
* Search for and select WPF App (.NET Framework)
  * **Caution:** The option WPF application will create a new project using .NET Core. .NET Framework is not compatible with .NET Core. It is easy to mistake the names of [different .NET platforms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-net-core-and-net-framework/).

## Add new unit tests

* Open the file to which you want to add unit tests.
* Right click anywhere inside the class you want to unit test.
* Select "Create Unit Tests" to automatically generate a file with placeholder tests.
